it turns out that using $parent is actually a bad practice, since we start coupling our expression code to the underlying DOM structure,
which makes our code less maintainable. Just imagine you have not only two nested scopes, but four or five. 
That would bring you into $parent.$parent.$parent.$parent hell, right?

Creating Directives:
    First let's talk about the API for registering directives. 
    Much like controllers, directives are registered on modules.
    To register a directive, you use the module.directive API. 
    module.directive takes the normalized directive name followed by a factory function.
    This factory function should return an object with the different options to tell $compile how the directive should behave when matched
    note: never create custom directive prefix with ng as it may have collision with directive include in angular future version.

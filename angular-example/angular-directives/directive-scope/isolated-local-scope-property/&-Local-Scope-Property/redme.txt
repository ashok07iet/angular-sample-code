At this point you’ve seen how to use local scope properties to pass values into a directive as strings (@) and how to bind to external objects using a two-way data binding technique (=). 
The final local scope property uses the & character and is used to bind to external functions.

The & local scope property allows the consumer of a directive to pass in a function that the directive can invoke.

At this point in the custom AngularJS directives series you’ve seen several of the key aspects available in directives such as templates, isolate scope, and local scope properties.

=    Used to create a two-way binding to an object that is passed into the directive
&    Allows an external function to be passed into the directive and invoked

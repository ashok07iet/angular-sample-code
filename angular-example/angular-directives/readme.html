    <h1>Directives</h1> 
    <p>At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children.</p>

    <h1>Normalization</h1>
    <p> Angular normalizes an element's tag and attribute name to determine which elements match which directives. We typically refer to directives by their case-sensitive camelCase normalized name (e.g. ngModel). However, since HTML is case-insensitive, we refer to directives in the DOM by lower-case forms, typically using dash-delimited attributes on DOM elements (e.g. ng-model).</p>
    <p>The normalization process is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Strip x- and data- from the front of the element/attributes.</li>
        <li>Convert the :, -, or _-delimited name to camelCase.</li>
    </ul>

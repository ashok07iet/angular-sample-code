        <h1>Directive types</h1>
        <p>
            $compile can match directives based on element names, attributes, class names, as well as comments.
            All of the Angular-provided directives match attribute name, tag name, comments, or class name.
            The following demonstrates the various ways a directive (myDir in this case) can be referenced from within a template.</p>
        <h1>examples</h1>
        <ul>  
            <li> &lt;my-dir&gt&lt/my-dir&gt</li>
            <li>&lt;span my-dir="exp"&gt&lt/span&gt</li>
            <li>&lt!-- directive: my-dir exp --&gt</li>
            <li>&ltspan class="my-dir: exp;"&gt&lt/span&gt</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Best Practice:</h1> 
    <p>
        Prefer using directives via tag name and attributes over comment and class names. 
        Doing so generally makes it easier to determine what directives a given element matches.

        When you create a directive, it is restricted to attribute and elements only by default.
        In order to create directives that are triggered by class name, you need to use the restrict option.
    </p>
    <p>
        The restrict option is typically set to:
    <ul>
        <li>'A' - only matches attribute name</li>
        <li>'E' - only matches element name</li>
        <li>'C' - only matches class name</li>
        <li>'M' - only matches comment</li>
    </ul>
     These restrictions can all be combined as needed:
    'AEC' - matches either attribute or element or class name
</p>

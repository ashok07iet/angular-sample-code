    Normalization:
     Angular normalizes an element's tag and attribute name to determine which elements match which directives.
     We typically refer to directives by their case-sensitive camelCase normalized name (e.g. ngModel).
     However, since HTML is case-insensitive, we refer to directives in the DOM by lower-case forms, typically using dash-delimited attributes on DOM elements (e.g. ng-model).
    The normalization process is as follows
        1.Strip x- and data- from the front of the element/attributes.
        2.Convert the :, -, or _-delimited name to camelCase.
     Best Practice: 
     Prefer using the dash-delimited format (e.g. ng-bind for ngBind). 
     If you want to use an HTML validating tool, you can instead use the data-prefixed version (e.g. data-ng-bind for ngBind). 
     The other forms shown above are accepted for legacy reasons but we advise you to avoid them.
